    "First, let' discuss frankly what's the function of the word filter in our daily life.\n",
    "the filter is always a method to extract a definite (always pure) output from an input of negative and noisy Impurities, for example, a water filter to get pure water, sound systems filters to get pure sound of high beats, even the artistic filters in some software packages like photoshop is used to get a more enhanced images.\n",
    "\n",
    "the expression (to get) in our processing cycle is sometimes known by segmentation, segmenting is extracting a definite object  with omission of surrounding environment of surrounding noise, or even if it's not for segmenting so it enhances our images by decreasing the details and sharp edges.\n",
    "  \n",
    "We can't express the actions of the filters in words so the optimum way to get known to them is to code and run.\n",
