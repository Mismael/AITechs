    "You may find that the title is not such interesting...it's corner detectors !! so ?\n",
    "but actually it's one of the most processing techniques which you can depend on it in some application like Optical Flow.\n",
    "but why corners...what is the interesting in it?!\n",
    "Look at this circle....\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let me ask you 2 questions....do this circle is rotating ? and where is the most distinct part in the circle?\n",
    "I know that you can't find the answer....by the way, this is a GIF image for a rotating circle, but do you know why can't you resolve this movement ?! simply...there is no corners to follow.\n",
    "Optical flow and motion detector applications depends to find the most good features in the frame image and locate corners to follow the motion of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There're two corners detectors algorithms known, Shi-Tomasi and Harris.\n",

    "Harris Corner Detector:\n",
    "as i mentioned previously that we are coding image processing algorithms by a library and to know how they work and there results without get boring with the mathematical calculations.\n",
    "so let's move to the code and see how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "but before that i'd like to inform you that the drawback of harris detector that the corners must be sharp and high defined to be detected so we will use a scale converter which will be used to multiply the pixels values in \"scale\" value and add \"shift\" value to enhance the detection, mostly it's weak and not accurate one.\n",
